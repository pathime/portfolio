<p>I am a London based web developer, with a background in music tech and a passion for building modern Javascript web apps.</p>
<p>I write clean, DRY, modular code using a stack which currently includes Angular, Angular 2, TypeScript, ES6, Node, MongoDB and Sass. I've also recently started playing around with the Web Audio API, and I will be posting little experiments and audio devices here. Have a nose around, and explore the code on GitHub.</p>
